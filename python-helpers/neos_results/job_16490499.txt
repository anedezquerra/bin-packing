Return codes description
------------------------
  0:  The final solution satisfies the termination conditions for verifying optimality.
  -100 to -199:  A feasible approximate solution was found.
  -200 to -299:  Knitro terminated at an infeasible point.
  -300 to -301:  The problem was determined to be unbounded.
  -400 to -499:  Knitro terminated because it reached a pre-defined limit.
    -400 to -409:  A feasible point was found.
    -410 to -419:  No feasible point was found.
  -500 to -599:  Knitro terminated with an input error or some non-standard error.
